For versions of GORM older than 6.0.10 or Spring Security Core Plugin prior to 3.1.2, `s2-quickstart` handles password 
encoding directly with the
injection of `SpringSecurityService` in the User class. Since Grails 3.2.8. service injection
is disabled in domain classes. However, you can turn service injection on in domain classes:

[source,groovy]
.grails-app/conf/application.yml
----
grails:
    gorm:
        # Whether to autowire entities.
        # Disabled by default for performance reasons.
        autowire: true
