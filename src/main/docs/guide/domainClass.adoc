We'll create a http://docs.grails.org/latest/ref/Domain%20Classes/Usage.html[Domain Class], `Announcement`, which we are going to use as an example through this guide:

[source, bash]
----
./grailsw create-domain-class Announcement
| Created grails-app/domain/example/grails/Announcement.groovy
| Created src/test/groovy/example/grails/AnnouncementSpec.groovy
----

[source,groovy]
.grails-app/domain/example/grails/Announcement.groovy
----
include::{sourceDir}/grails-app/domain/example/grails/Announcement.groovy[indent=0]
----
